I struggled with this challenge more than I have struggle in anything I have ever done. I was never able to get going, I struggled from the start and there was no light. I am very disappointed in myself and the work I did here in this challenge, I wish I could have donr more. I only had 7 commits but there was really nothing for me to commit, besides I am more disappointed about the work I did that the number of commits I made. I definitely have to do better, and I will. I am really sorry.
